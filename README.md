# Car_Price_Prediction
# 🚗 Car Sales Price Analysis & Prediction

This project was completed as part of my **Data Science Internship** at **Infotact Solutions**. The objective was to analyze historical car sales data, uncover key insights, and build predictive models to estimate car selling prices.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw car dataset
- Perform in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize key trends (vehicle age, fuel type, transmission, etc.)
- Engineer features for better model performance
- Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models
- Optimize models using Hyperparameter Tuning
- Identify the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)
- Feature importance using ExtraTreesRegressor
- Comparing multiple regression models
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Metrics used: MAE, MSE, RMSE, R², Explained Variance Score

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Modeling:** Linear Regression, SVR, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Ridge, Lasso  
- **Tuning:** GridSearchCV  
- **IDE:** Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

- Visualized trends in selling price by fuel type, transmission type, vehicle age, etc.
- Found that **fuel type** and **transmission** significantly affect the price
- Feature engineering helped improve model performance
